## Description of the Project

### Taken from the project itself.
At some point in your journey to become a full-stack web developer, you’ll likely be asked to complete a coding assessment&mdash;perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment includes both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. 

To help familiarize you with these tests and allow you to use the skills covered in this module, this Challenge invites you to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 

This week’s coursework will equip you with all the skills you need to succeed in this assignment.

### User Story:

AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

### Acceptance Criteria:

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz

- WHEN I click the start button THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

- WHEN I answer a question THEN I am presented with another question

- WHEN I answer a question incorrectly THEN time is subtracted from the clock

- WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 THEN the game is over

- WHEN the game is over THEN I can save my initials and my score

## Visuals

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
